- g \*    same as \* but allows partial matches
- g d    go to (local) variable definition
- g D    go to (global) variable definition

### Go to Functions
- ctrl + ]      search for tag under the cursor and jump to first match
- ctrl + T      jump back in the tag stack
- g ]           search for tag under the cursor and list matches
- t n           jump to the next matching tag
- t s           list matches for the last tag search
- t p           jump to the previous matching tag
